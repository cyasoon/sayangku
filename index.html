            Hye my lovely SayangðŸ’—,
             <br /><br />
            I've been carrying something in my heart, and I just need to lay it all out for you. You know, when I say, "I Love You So Much, SayangðŸ’—", it's not just words I'm throwing around. It's a feeling that's rooted deep in my soul, and I want you to feel it.
            <br><br>
            You, my girlfriend, are not just special, you're the love of my life. I'm too obsessed with you, and I say that with the biggest smile because it's good kind of obsession. Your laughter? It's my favourite sound and melody, SayangðŸ’—, and those eyes of yours? They're like constellations, lighting up my world.
            <br><br>
            The thought of losing you? Honestly, it's a fear I never knew I could feel until you became such a big part of my life. You're not just my anchor, you're the wind of my sails. I'm all in for us, for making our love the kind that stands the test of time.
            <br><br>
            Missing you is more than just a feeling, It's a deep ache that I carry when we're not together. You're the missing pieces that turns my days from ordinary to extraordnary. I hope you feel it too, even when we're miles apart.
            <br><br>
            Every day, every hour, every minute, every second..it's all about you, SayangðŸ’—. You're my daydream, making even the most mundane moments feel like scenes from a romantic movie. You're the reason I randomly smile throughout the day and why my heart does a happy dance.
            <br><br>
            Our love story, it's like something written in the stars, filled with laughter, understanding, and a love that keeps growing. I'm hoping and praying that it stays this way..pure, passionate, and enduring.
            <br><br>
            And let me indulge in a bit of wishful thinking: dreaming of the day we finally meet face to face. No more screens, just us, shared glances, and whispered words. SayangðŸ’—, let's create our own romantic adventures, where our love story unfolds in the most beautiful way.
            <br><br>
            You're not just my love, you're my everything. I can't wait for the day when I can hold you close, look into your eyes, and spill my heart out to you in person. Until then, you're in my thoughts, in my heart, and in every romantic daydream I have.
            <br><br>
            I Love You So Much, MaiiLuv SayangðŸ’—,
            <br><br>
            With all my love,
            <br><br>
            Your baby,
            <br>
